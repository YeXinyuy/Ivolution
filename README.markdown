#[Take one picture of yourself a day, automatically generate a movie!](http://jlengrand.github.com/Ivolution/)


**Ivolution** is a simple project that aims at helping you create videos of yourself over time, using photos as input.
Simply take several pictures of yourself in the same position, and decide when to compile everything into a video. Just indicate the location of your pictures, Ivolution does everything else for you. 

Due to its general implementation, FaceMovie may be used for faces, but also profiles (for projects showing [women along pregnancy for example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG_KArKYTq4) or full body([for people workouting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Pzfv7JV48)). The only limitation comes from you !
